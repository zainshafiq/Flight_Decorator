ENSE 470 U of R - Decorator Pattern

Design the system using design pattern(s) that you have learnt (you may use more than
one design pattern at the same time). Note that in the design you must separate the
functionalities, be able to iterate through the database, and be able to easily add any (or all)
options to the flight ticket.
